# ðŸ§  Modeling_and_Simulation_Labs

This repository contains my solutions for all the laboratory exercises of the "Modeling and Simulation" course at the Higher School of Computer Science (08 May 1945), Sidi Bel Abbes, Algeria, for 1st-year Master's students specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

### ðŸ“ˆNotebook 1: Introduction and General Concepts

This lab introduces the basic concepts of Modeling and Simulation and the importance of these techniques in various fields. We explore different types of simulation methods and how models represent real-world systems.

### ðŸ“ˆNotebook 2: Introduction to Programming with Python 3 for Scientific Computing 

In this notebook, we cover the basics of Python 3 programming for scientific applications, introducing libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib to perform computations, data analysis, and visualize results.

### ðŸ“ˆNotebook 3: Probabilities and Random Number Simulation

We explore concepts of probability theory and demonstrate how to use Python to simulate random number generation for various distributions, such as uniform, normal, and Poisson distributions.

### ðŸ“ˆNotebook 4: Modeling Dynamical Systems

In this notebook, we model dynamical systems using differential equations. We simulate the behavior of systems that evolve over time, such as population growth models and mechanical systems.

### ðŸ“ˆNotebook 5: Solving Problems with Monte-Carlo Simulation Technique

Here, we introduce the Monte-Carlo simulation technique to solve problems involving randomness and uncertainty. We demonstrate how to apply Monte-Carlo methods to estimate integrals, optimize functions, and solve probabilistic problems.

### ðŸ“ˆNotebook 6: Stochastic Processes and Markov-Chain

We explore stochastic processes and their applications, focusing on Markov chains to model systems where the future state depends only on the present state. Examples include queueing systems, financial markets, and biological processes.

### ðŸ“ˆNotebook 7: Modeling and Simulating Discrete-Event Systems

This notebook focuses on discrete-event systems, where events occur at specific points in time. We simulate processes such as manufacturing systems, telecommunications, and traffic systems using event-driven models.
